Mo-Bot is an advanced bot for Xat chatrooms. It uses the Firefox Add-on "Scriptish" to run JavaScript code on Xat's mobile chat (Note: GreaseMonkey cannot be used with this script. This script takes advantage of useful functions in Scriptish that are not present in GreaseMonkey!). This bot does NOT need Xat's rip-off "BOT Power" to run!

Xat's mobile chat is written in JavaScript itself, so because of that I am able to edit their source code directly from my script and customize it to my liking. There are many possibilities with this.

Currently the bot can do many, many things. A lot of things this bot does, most PHP bots can't even do. Soon, they will probably try and replicate its functionality, but will most likely not be able to.
